# Comparison-of-classification-algorithms like SVM, Decision trees and Boosting along learning curves
â€¢	Implemented two learning algorithms Artificial neural networks (ANN) and K Nearest Neighbors. Used TensorFlow and Keras to implement Neural Networks to classify the problems. Experimented with number of layers and number of nodes, activation functions (sigmoid, tanh) for the Neural Network. Used K-Nearest Neighbors to classify the problems. Experimented with number of neighbors and the distance metric. Plotted learning curves like error rates vs. train data size, error rates vs. clock time to train/test. Made performance comparisons (learning curves, confusion matrices, etc.) of various functions/parameters for the algorithms (e.g. ANN number of layers, nodes, number of neighbors in KNN)
